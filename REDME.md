Introduction to the system
MeroGhar is the android smartphone application that is developed with the purpose of simplifying and providing a platform to search houses/properties for buying, selling or renting services.

REST Client
Retrofit and its uses
Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.
Retrofit can be configured to use a specific converter. This converter handles the data (de)serialization. Several converters are already available for various serialization formats.

Following dependencies were used for Retrofit
com.squareup.retrofit:converter-gson
com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.5.0
com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.5.0
